Hey hey, Iâ€™m @hazelune, call me Hazel!

I'm fairly new to serious coding, although I've been exposed to it for most of my life. 
I've really only been doing it for 9 months at this point (aside from a camp or two in elementary school), and 
my only formal education on it is an AP Computer Science A class I took this past year. Everything else I know is self-taught, 
although I have two brothers who are CS students, so that should help.


My knowledge on different languages is:
  - Java, moderately well
  - Python, meh
  - JavaScript, alright
  - HTML, so-so
  - CSS, also so-so
  - Lua, like 3 hours worth
  

I'm currently trying to learn web design and how to utilize APIs, but past that, I'm not sure. Web design is pretty neat, after all.

Hopefully, some of the programming knowledge will come in handy in the form of making a cool website to showcase my prinary 
interest, art, while being pretty impressive in the process. Not many people have self-designed website portfolios, I'd imagine.


If you'd like to contact me, feel free to reach out at:
  - [@hazelune_](https://twitter.com/hazelune_) on Twitter
    - You'll have to put up with my inane ramblings about smash, politics, and how I'm really, really trans, though
  - My email, hazelune0@gmail.com
  - Probably other social media platforms in the future I guess?
  
Have a great day, and please don't judge my work too harshly ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ‘ˆ
